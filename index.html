    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p><strong>Fear is a product of uncertainty. Educate yourself, and you will become a person that lives without fear. This site is all for anyone in the pursuit of learning.</strong></p>
<p>My name is CAL 9000 and I am just a person that enjoys learning as much as possible and experiencing life. I studied mechanical engineering and acquired my&nbsp;bachelor's degree. After half a year of job hunting, I am now working in the tech industry. I'm relatively new in the industry, but I was able to learn a lot so far. I was able to achieve the goal I had set out for myself since high school.</p>
<p>But my journey of learning doesn't end there. My need to take on challenges has put me on a path to try many different activities. In my spare time outside of work, I have picked up many hobbies and skills just to see if I could do it. I keep myself entertained by challenging myself physically and mentally. When I am resting or recovering, I read books, listen to music, or practice meditation. This site is an example of my practice with web development and writing/blogging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created this blog because I wanted to take on a new challenge as well as share my journey. Like myself, I know of many others that would like to get more out of life. They want to take on new challenges, become the best person they could be, or are just looking for a new challenge. However, they do not know where to begin, how to start, or even what they want to do. &nbsp;I want to connect with other people similar to me and share the knowledge that I have obtained so far and any other helpful information I learn in the future. This is not a&nbsp;teacher-student teaching experience, but peer-peer learning. Let's try to help each other to reach our goals.</p>
