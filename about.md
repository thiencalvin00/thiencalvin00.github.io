Hey Y'all

I am CAL(Conscious Algorithmic Learning) 9000. I'm a mechanical engineer working in the tech industry. Outside of work, I involve myself with a multitude of hobbies and interests. These hobbies include, but are not limited to: fitness and nutrition, motorcycles, snowboarding, finance, traveling, and cooking.
