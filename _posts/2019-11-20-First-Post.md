So let's kick off the new year with a new blog. You can see what the blog is going to mainly be about by checking the "About" page.

Now onto the actual blog. A new year comes with New Year's resolutions. I see this time as a good time to set milestones for the year. If you don't already have long term goals, then you should probably think about that first so you can set realistic milestones each year. I like to set milestones for specific categories of my life, suck as career and life. For example, this year I'm setting a goal to track all my spendings and spend less than or equal to $25k total for the year. This will include all spendings such as rent, bills, groceries, gas, airline tickets, etc. This is the first step to my overall plan of reaching financial independance in 10-15 years.

Generally I recommend that you track all your spendings. You can use the Mint app and link all your accounts, or if you're skeptical about linking your accounts then you can use a spreadsheet to do that. I personally use a spreadsheet I created to track all my spendings and compile it to a really convenient way of looking at all my spendings and income. You'll be able to really see what yo're wasting your money on and consider better alternatives. 

What I'm trying to do this year is set challenges every month. For example, in february, I'm doing a no spending challenge. For the whole month, I'm going to avoid spending any mone ythat isn't on essentials like my bills. No going out for food, and no purchases of material items. All the money I save that month will be goig straight to my IRA account. another cahllenge I came up with is a spring cleaning in march. For the whole month of march, I'll be decluterring everything that I have accumluated from last year. I'll take a look at everything I own and ask "Did I use this item at all last year? Last 6  months? Last month? If I didn't then I'll consider giving it away or selling it. You'd be able to get some pretty good returns on all these items depending on their condition. All the money I make from this will be depositied straight into my IRA.

I belienve that a lot of people consume too much. This consumer culture has caused aa lot of people to be very wasteful. This is not only harmful to your wellbeing, but to the envinoment as well. A lot of the products we waste are made of plastic, and most plastics currently produced are not biodegradable. Create a challenge for yourself this year or participate in one of my challenges. See how much money you could save and you'llbe glad you decided not to go and buy that sweater you'll probably only wear for a week and leave it somewhere in the back of your closet.
