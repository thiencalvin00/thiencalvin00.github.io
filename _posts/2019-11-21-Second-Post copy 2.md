So let's kick off the new year with a new blog. You can see what the blog is going to mainly be about by checking the "About" page.

Now onto the actual blog. A new year comes with New Year's resolutions. I see this time as a good time to set milestones for the year. If you don't already have long term goals, then you should probably think about that first so you can set realistic milestones each year. I like to set milestones for specific categories of my life, suck as career and life. For example, this year I'm setting a goal to track all my spendings and spend less than or equal to $25k total for the year. This will include all spendings such as rent, bills, groceries, gas, airline tickets, etc. This is the first step to my overall plan of reaching financial freedom in 10-15 years.
